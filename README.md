## TubeCentric Browser Extension
Chrome & Firefox extension which communicated with the TubeCentric server. The extension would watch the user's window for a specific URL, and if the user was on specific YouTube related URL it would inject dom elements within the page via javascript and React.

These injected dom elements would allow the user to search related key words and bring back ranked tags from a serach from the TubeCentric server. The user could select the tags which would be added to the YouTube webpage's input fields.

The idea behind this was to help the YouTube content creator quickly and easily add new tags for meta data on their vidoes they were uploading or editing.
