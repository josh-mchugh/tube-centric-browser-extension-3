      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

          Thanks for checking out my channel, I am Gone and I do let's plays, walkthroughs , playthroughs, and general gameplays of video games or whatever you want to call them in my spare time.  I think the best way to play a video is to play with others and luckily with the internet you can see my terrible gaming skills and commentary. Ultimately I hope you find it entertaining and hopefully made you smile or laugh at some point. Anyways, I am here to play video games and chew gumâ€¦ and I am all out of gum so lets play some video games! Leave a comment and a like and I will catch you in the new episode!!
